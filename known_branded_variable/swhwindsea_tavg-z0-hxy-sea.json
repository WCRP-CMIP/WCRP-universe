  "description": "Average height of the highest one-third of waves present in the sea state, incorporating just wind-sea waves (i.e., local wind waves). It is derived from the wind-sea wave spectrum using spectral moments. Specifically, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional wind-sea wave spectrum.",
