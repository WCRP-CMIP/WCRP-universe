Phytoplankton are algae that grow where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. \"Iron growth limitation\" means the ratio of the growth rate of a species population in the environment (where there is a finite availability of iron) to the theoretical growth rate if there were no such limit on iron availability.",
