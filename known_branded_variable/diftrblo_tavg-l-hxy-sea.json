  "description": "Ocean tracer diffusivity associated with parameterized eddy-induced advective transport. Sometimes this diffusivity is called the \"thickness\" diffusivity. For CMIP5, this diagnostic was called \"ocean tracer bolus laplacian diffusivity\".  The CMIP6 name is physically more relevant.",
