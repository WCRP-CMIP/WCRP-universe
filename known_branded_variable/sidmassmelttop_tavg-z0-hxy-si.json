  "description": "Rate of change of sea-ice mass through melting at the ice surface divided by grid-cell area. This number is independent of the actual fate of the meltwater, and will hence include all sea-ice meltwater that drains into the ocean and all sea-ice meltwater that is collected by a melt-pond parameterisation. Always negative or zero.",
