  "description": "Rate of change of sea-ice mass through melting/dissolution at the ice bottom divided by grid-cell area. Note that this number is always zero or negative since sea-ice growth is collected in sidmassgrowthbot. This is to account for differential growth and melt in models with a sub-grid scale ice thickness distribution.",
