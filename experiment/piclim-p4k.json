    "description": "1. Detailed experiment configuration An atmosphere only configuration following piClim-control but with the sea surface temperature in sea ice free conditions uniformly increased by 4K  2. Required model settings AGCM. The experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control.   3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.) AerChemMIP2 - Unraveling the role of reactive gases, aerosols, and land use for air quality and climate change in CMIP7  5. Similarities to CMIP6 experiments  6. Forcing differences from parent experiment Sea-surface temperature pattern of piClim-control increased by 4K",
