  "description": "The ocean component is based on NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) version 3.6 in the Global Ocean 7.0 configuration. The model includes comprehensive representation of ocean dynamics using primitive equations, advanced mixing schemes including Gent-McWilliams parameterization for mesoscale eddies, and detailed treatment of boundary layer processes. The model uses z-star vertical coordinates with partial cells to improve representation of bottom topography. Tidal mixing is parameterized, and the model includes enhanced mixing in the equatorial region. Sea ice interactions are fully coupled through exchanges of momentum, heat, and freshwater.",
