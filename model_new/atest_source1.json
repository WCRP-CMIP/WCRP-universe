  "description": "HadGEM3-GC31-HH is a high-resolution global coupled climate model developed by the UK Met Office. The model includes a dynamically simulated atmosphere component using the Unified Model (UM) with comprehensive representation of physical processes including radiation, convection, and boundary layer dynamics. The land surface is represented by the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) which calculates water, energy, and carbon fluxes between the surface and atmosphere, including vegetation dynamics and soil processes. The ocean component uses the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) with detailed representation of ocean dynamics, thermodynamics, and mixing processes. Sea ice is simulated using the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE) which includes comprehensive ice dynamics and thermodynamics. Ocean biogeochemistry is represented by the Model of Ecosystem Dynamics, nutrient Utilisation, Sequestration and Acidification (MEDUSA) which simulates marine carbon cycle and ecosystem processes. Atmospheric chemistry is prescribed using monthly mean three-dimensional ozone concentrations from observations and does not include interactive chemical processes. Aerosol distributions are prescribed using monthly mean fields derived from separate atmospheric chemistry-aerosol model simulations and do not interact dynamically with the radiation scheme. Land ice processes are completely omitted from this model configuration.",

The model includes detailed treatments of radiation (using the Suite of Community RAdiative Transfer codes based on Edwards and Slingo, SOCRATES), convection (using the Gregory-Rowntree mass-flux scheme), cloud microphysics (using the Wilson-Ballard scheme), and boundary layer processes (using the Lock et al. scheme). The model uses a semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme for time integration and employs a hybrid height coordinate system in the vertical. The atmospheric chemistry component is prescribed rather than interactive, using monthly mean three-dimensional ozone concentrations. Aerosol interactions are limited to prescribed climatological distributions.",
