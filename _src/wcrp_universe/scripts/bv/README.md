for the branded variable : today there is script and list of known branded variable here : 


https://github.com/znichollscr/CMIP7_DReq_Content/tree/extract-branded-variables/branded-variables


the best appraoch would be to get everything moved here but to ease dev/debug/curation, it will be on this repo for a while.
the script in the universe will only copy the list from there. At least for now 


This ReadMe MUST BE remove if the CMIP7_DReq_Content repo is move here
