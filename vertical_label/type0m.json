    "description": "<type>0<m>, for a variable that should be reported on a single coordinate surface or that represents a single layer defined by coordinate bounds, where <type> is replaced by 'h', 'p', 'z', or 'rho' (which have the same meaning as defined in the first 4 bulleted points above), and m is the coordinate value associated with the level or layer, expressed in the following units: meters for 'h' or 'z', hPa for 'p', and 'sigma-t units' (density in kg m-3 - 1000 kg m-3) for 'rho'.  For example, 'p0500' could be used to identify the 500 mb level and rho026 would indicate a density of 1026 kg m-3.  For m, the character 'p' can be used to replace a decimal point if one is needed, and at least one digit, must precede the decimal point (e.g., 'h00p5' represents 0.5 meters above the surface; note also that 'h0p5' would be incorrect).  For this vertical label to apply under CMIP6 data requirements, the vertical coordinate value must also be recorded in the file as a scalar dimension recorded by the CF conventions 'coordinates' attribute.  Note that 'z00' indicates that there is a depth scalar coordinate attached to the variable and set to 0 m.  If the standard name for a variable already indicates that it is a surface variable (e.g., 'surface_temperature'), then it is good practice to omit explicit specification of the vertical location, so that 'z0' would be the correct verticalLabelDD, not 'z00'.",
