Note that some collections might permit groups to include additional levels (not in the list of those required), but this would not affect the value of n, which is the number of required (requested) levels.  In the case that the number of levels reported is not specified but left up to the data provider, <n> is replaced by 'n' and  <x> is omitted.s",
